                    <p>Nothing much to be said- its the site you're using right now! I've made many variations of it over the years, and it's been on 3 different domains. First it was "violets-puragtory.github.io", then moved to "violets-puragtory.com", and lastly (now) to violets-purgatory.dev! My first time coding any HTML on my own, and technically the first iteration of this site, was a css animation of the "homophobic dog" meme sliding on screen accompanied by the role sound effect from amongus. I was like 13 don't judge me I thought it was funny.</p>

                    <p>Univerter is my Javascriptless Youtube video downloader! I tend to call it a "converter" rather than a downloader, because unlike many other youtube downloaders, mine actually converts to more formats than youtube supports! I've been working on Univerter for a long time, and i hope to support more sites soon :>. It also comes with a (experimental) standalone video converter! Please, check it out at <a href="https://univerter.dev">univerter.dev</a> or <a href="https://yt.violets-purgatory.dev">yt.violets-purgatory.dev</a> and report any issues or feature requests!</p>

                    <p>Don't get it confused with Violet's Purgatory! I know, me and my stupid naming schemes T^T. Violet's Limbo is the name for my blog site, where i just kinda post unimportant game rants! Currently it's very early in development, and much of it's code is sorta "Make now fix later"... But despite its rushed development, i love posting blogs on there! Currently there isn't much, but feel free to check it out at <a href="https://blog.violets-purgatory.dev">blog.violets-purgatory.dev</a>!</p>

                    <p>Simpletube is my work in progress Javascriptless Youtube Frontend! It's not quite done, but it does support many features, and i'm quite happy with how it's going so far! Sadly, it currently isn't hosted anywhere, but the code can be found <a href="https://codeberg.org/Bingus_Violet/SimpleTube">here</a>! I hope to re-continue development on it soon, and finally find somewhere to host it!</p>

                    <p>When playing games like Gunfire Reborn, I was annoyed that they'd only support Rich presence on Steam but not Discord. I was also having issues at the time with getting games under proton to show up on discord in general. As a solution, i made a (Linux only, sadly) software called SteamRPC, which converts the presence of any Steam game onto Discord using a Rich presence bot. It certainly needs optimization, but it's a project im proud of, and one of my few projects I use all the time!</p>

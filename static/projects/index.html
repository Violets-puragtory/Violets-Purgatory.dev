                    <p>Nothing much to be said- its the site you're using right now! I've made many variations of it over the years, and it's been on 3 different domains. First it was "violets-puragtory.github.io", then moved to "violets-puragtory.com", and lastly (now) to violets-purgatory.dev! My first time coding any HTML on my own, and technically the first iteration of this site, was a css animation of the "homophobic dog" meme sliding on screen accompanied by the role sound effect from amongus. I was like 13 don't judge me I thought it was funny.</p>

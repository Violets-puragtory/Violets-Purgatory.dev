        <p>Currently i'm working on the new system for word highlighting!</p>
        <p>You can see that it is pretty much the same as before, outside of the code being a little bit shorter and
            more dispersed (I didn't know until recently that "replaceAll" was a function...)</p>
        <p>The big difference, is unlike the original site, this can apply to all pages!</p>
